Version 0.2 - added Wordpress support, merged css, basic responsiveness.
- Uses colour variables so will not work on Internet Explorer (flag if this is an issue and fallbacks can be added)
- .Woff versions of fonts used as the smallest - but ttf and otf versions are included. To further improve speed, change font-family to 'inherit' to use the theme fonts (FontAwesome is still needed)
- Many sprites have been removed - animated gifs (loaders) are kept, as are a few sprites that are either hard to replace with FA (ie the select2 dropdown arrows), or whose use is unclear
- More testing is needed, issues welcome.

Version 0.1 
- is a quick merge of the default civicrm.css and civicrm-shelford.css. This means some sprite paths may be broken and there are duplicate selectors.
- use of CSS variables not supported by IE or < MS Edge 15.
- not tested on Wordpress, Backdrop or Drupal 8.
